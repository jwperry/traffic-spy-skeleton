When an identifer exists return a page that displays the following:

- Most requested URLS to least requested URLS (url)
  @application.sorted_urls_by_request
  Iterate through and take :url from key, and value (count)

  ex: @application.sorted_urls_by_request.each do |a, b|
        a[:url] #url_path
        b #count
        #html code goes here inserting a and b where needed
      end

- Web browser breakdown across all requests (userAgent)
  #user requests outputs as: [["Chrome 24.0.1309", "Mac OS X 10.8.2"]]
  #each nested hash contains user_agent at [0], and OS at [1]

  @application.user_agents[0][0] for user agent

  (indexes need to be iterated through to display list)

- OS breakdown across all requests (userAgent)

  @application.user_agents[0][1] <- [1] indicates OS
  (same as above)

- Screen Resolution across all requests (resolutionWidth x resolutionHeight)
  iterate through and display height and width

  @application.uniq_screen_resolutions.each do |a|
    a[0] #equals height
    a[1] #equals width
  end

  first index selects unique screen resolution

- Longest, average response time per URL to shortest, average response time per URL
  @application.average_response_times[0]
  @application.average_response_times[-1]
